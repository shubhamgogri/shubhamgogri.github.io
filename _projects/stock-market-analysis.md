## Overview

Time-series analysis and forecasting for major tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon) using deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches.

## Approach

**Data:**
- Historical stock data for top tech companies
- Feature engineering for time-series characteristics

**Models:**
- LSTM networks for sequence prediction
- Comparison with traditional ML regression models
- Qualitative analysis of prediction quality

**Evaluation:**
- Regression metrics (MAE, RMSE)
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual prices
- Analysis of model behavior during volatile periods

## Key Learnings

- Time-series forecasting requires careful feature engineering
- LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies effectively
- Financial data presents unique challenges (non-stationarity, regime changes)

## Tech Stack

`Python` `TensorFlow/Keras` `LSTM` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib`
