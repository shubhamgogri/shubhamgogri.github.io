## Hi, I'm Shubham

I'm a machine learning engineer who thrives on working across the entire ML lifecycle—from scoping data pipelines and validating ideas, to productionizing models and keeping them healthy in production.

Currently at Cloudbeds, I work as a generalist across data science and ML teams, building validation frameworks and feature pipelines for pricing optimization systems serving 20K+ hospitality properties worldwide.

I enjoy being the person who connects research ideas to production reality—whether it's collaborating with data scientists on model improvements, maintaining AWS infrastructure, or owning end-to-end pipelines.

## My Journey

Before Cloudbeds, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence with Distinction at the University of Surrey. My dissertation on generative neural networks for medical imaging was nominated for the Best Dissertation Award and presented at ICMLMI 2023.

That research taught me something crucial: the gap between a working model and a production system is where most ML projects fail. I discovered my strength lies in bridging that gap—building the validation layer that gives teams confidence to deploy.

## What I Focus On

I specialize in experimental validation and ML infrastructure—building frameworks that test algorithms before production, architecting scalable feature pipelines, and implementing monitoring systems for production observability.

See my [experience](/experience/) for a timeline of my work, [projects](/projects/) for technical deep-dives, and [resume](/resume/) for comprehensive details including technical skills and recognition.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing ML engineering challenges, production systems, or potential collaborations.
